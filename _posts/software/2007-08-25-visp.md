ViSP standing for *Visual Servoing Platform* is a modular cross platform library that allows prototyping 
and developing applications using visual tracking and visual servoing technics at the heart of the 
researches done by Inria Lagadic team. ViSP is able to compute control laws that can be applied to robotic systems. 
It provides a set of visual features that can be tracked using real time image processing or computer vision algorithms. 
ViSP provides also simulation capabilities. A general overview of ViSP features is provided here.

ViSP can be useful in robotics, computer vision, augmented reality and computer animation.

Written in C++, the software provides a set of modules available under Linux, OSX and Windows. 
To extend ViSP capabilities, it allows interoperability with optional third-party libraries.

ViSP is open-source with a GNU GPLv2 license. 
A professional edition license is also available. 
More information about ViSP licensing is provided here.

ViSP is developed and maintained by the Inria Lagadic team located at Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique.

Under development since 1999, ViSP is supported by INRIA.
