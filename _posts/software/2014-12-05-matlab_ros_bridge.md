This software consists of a set of Matlab C++ S-functions that can be used to:

* synchronize simulink with the system clock, thus obtaining a soft-real-time execution;
* interface simulink blocks with other ROS nodes using ROS messages.

This project is based on a work started by Martin Riedel and Riccardo Spica at the Max Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tuebingen (Germany).
This fork is currently supported by [Riccardo Spica](mailto:riccardo.spica@irisa.fr) and [Giovanni Claudio](mailto:giovanni.claudio@irisa.fr) at the Inria Istitute in Rennes (France).

The software is released under the BSD license. See the LICENSE file in this repository for more information.
