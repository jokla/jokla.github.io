V-Rep ROS Bridge is a plugin for V-Rep developed by the Inria Lagadic team located at Inria Rennes.

The main application of the plugin is to provide a communication interface between V-Rep and (ROS). 
The aim is to control the V-Rep simulation externally using ROS messages and ROS services.

V-Rep is a General purpose 3D robot simulator with integrated development environment developed by 
Coppelia Robotics. Sensors, mechanisms, robots and whole systems can be modelled and simulated in various ways.
