The contains demos, classes, tools and data for the humanoid robot Romeo from Aldebaran.

# Demos:

## Detection
* Face detection using OpenCV Haar cascade.
* Face detection and Recognition using the OKAO Vision library (ALFaceDetection naoqi module).
* Color based object detection. 

## Servoing
* Face tracking and servoing of head and eyes to center it on the image.
* Blobs tracking and servoing head and eyes to center it on the image.

## Grasping

### Gras_box:
 * Aim of the demo is grasp a box and to deliver it to an human. Here the steps of the demo:
 * Detect and track a box by color information.
 * Use keypoints to detect and estimate the pose of the box (with know cad model). 
 * Track the box using the model-based tracker.
 * Grasp of the box.
 * Detect person and deliver the box.
 
# Classes:
* Face detection (OpenCV library).
* QR-Code detection (zbar library).
* Servo arm and Servo head class.
* Localization object with know model.
* Detection object from color information (with learning color phase).
