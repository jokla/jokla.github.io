intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I love music. Music is part of me since I was little, and it will always be. I started to sing when I was seven years old, and I  am still doing it! I joined the polyphonic choir  "[JanuaVox](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/JanuaVox)" (2001-2003) and “[I polifonici di Genova](http://www.polifonicidigenova.org/2009/index.php)” (2003 - 2008) in Genoa. Later I got interested in contemporary music, and I have begun to take pop/rock singing lesson. I competed in several competitions in Genoa, joined some groups, and sang to wedding and party. I attended to the [AIMS Summer School](http://www.aims.uk.com/) Eastbourne (UK) attending the following courses: Cabaret class, Vocal Technique and Musical class.
  In France, I am participating to "Fête de la Musique" ([World Music Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte_de_la_Musique)) and recently I am creating a home recording studio to record acoustic pieces (piano and voice).

    excerpt: 'Mika opened a competition to be part of his choir for a concert in London. I decided to participate in the audition and finally I was chosen! I met a lot of nice people, learned my part with the members of the band (mainly with the guitarist Tim Van Der Kuil, who plays guitar for Adele too), danced and sang with Mika on the [Roundhouse](http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/) stage!  It was an excellent experience that I will never forget. [Here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/770/8271183487/in/album-72157632254422212/) some nice pictures! '

    excerpt: 'Yann Tiersen is one of my favourite contemporary piano composers, you may know him thanks to the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d1pfcYkCqI&list=PLA116EF3328E17501) of the film Amélie. During his Midsummer Cycling Tour in Brittany, he stopped at the Blind Spot Records in Rennes, where I had the opportunity to have a nice talk with him. His new album, called [Eusa](http://eusasound.bzh/#firstPage) is comprised of 10 new solo piano pieces inspired by locations on the island of Ushant in Brittany, where Tiersen lives.'

I sang a classical Italian piece called [La voce del silenzio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Voices_(Dionne_Warwick_song)), presented for the first time at the Festival of Sanremo 1968 in the interpretation of Tony Del Monaco and as "Silent Voices" by Dionne Warwick.
