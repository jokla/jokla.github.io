Hi! My name is Giovanni Claudio. I’m originally from Genoa, Italy, and now based in London.
<br><br>
From 2013 to 2017, I worked as a Robotics Engineer in the [Lagadic](http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/) group at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/) in Rennes. In 2017, I joined the Autonomous Driving team at [Italdesign Giugiaro](http://www.italdesign.it), where I led projects in machine learning and computer vision for autonomous vehicles and mobility solutions. Since 2019, I’ve been in London, building autonomous mobile robots at [Arrival](https://arrival.com/), and I am now a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Medtronic, developing AI-powered video systems for surgical robotics. See [here](http://giovanniclaudio.com/work/) for more information.
