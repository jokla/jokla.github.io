Hi! My name is Giovanni Claudio. I am from Genoa (Italy) and now I am living in London.
<br><br>
From 2013-2017 I worked as Robotics Engineer in the [Lagadic](http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/) group at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/) in Rennes. In September 2017 I joined the Autonomous Driving team at [Italdesign Giugiaro](http://www.italdesign.it). I moved to London in September 2019 to buid autonomous mobile robots in [Arrival](https://arrival.com/). See [here](http://jokla.me/work/) for more information.

<br><br>
You can download my CV here:   <a href="{{ site.url }}/share/Claudio_CV.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download "></i></a>.
<br><br>
When I am not playing with robots, you will find me singing in a music rehearsal room or taking pictures with my Nikon around!
