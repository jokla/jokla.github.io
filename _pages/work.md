    title: "2017-2019 - Autonomous Driving Engineer"
    excerpt: 'In September 2017, I joined Italdesign as Autonomous Driving Engineer. My primary task was to research, implement and deploy perception, mapping/localization and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles. I worked on several projects, such as:   
    
- [Pop.Up Next](https://www.italdesign.it/project/pop-up-next/) in collaboration with Airbus and Audi: an electric, modular and autonomous flying car.   

- [Wheem-i](https://www.italdesign.it/project/wheem-i/), before known as Moby: the first mobility service designed for wheelchair users.   

- [InTo](https://into.italdesign.it/index_en.html): a system for measuring the flow of passengers with LEDs that reveal which railcars are the least crowded for boarding.   

- [Roborace](https://www.italdesign.it/roborace-italdesign-and-datalab-munich-to-accelerate-machine-learning-together/): machine learning research and development project to push the limit of the robocar DevBot 2.0.

    alt: "My job"
    title: "2013-2017 - R&D Robotics Engineer"
    excerpt: 'In November 2013 I joined the team [Lagadic](http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/)  in INRIA Rennes led by [François Chaumette](http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/Francois.Chaumette-eng.html) with the role of R&D Robotics Engineer. My goal was to make robots smarter, helping them to perceive and understand our world and to take action autonomously.   


I worked on real-time detection, pose estimation and tracking and I implemented state-of-the-art visual servoing algorithms that significantly improved the robustness and accuracy of several types of robots (mobile, humanoid, industrial robots and drones). To validate these approaches, I created numerous demonstrations using 2D and RGB-D cameras, radars and microphones. 


I also worked on improving the perception and motion of the humanoid robots Romeo and Pepper. These robots can now track a target with their gaze, detect and follow a person, detect and grasp objects, deliver them to a human, manipulate them using two hands simultaneously and open a door.


I have contributed to the development of a framework based on ROS, MATLAB/Simulink, and V-REP, for a fast prototyping of robot control algorithms. This system allows testing sensor-based control algorithms before on simulated robots in V-REP and later on the real robots, with a few changes. 


In the last years, I supervised several student internships and I am participating as a mentor in the Google Summer of Code. I also published scientific articles at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), ICRA’17 and Humanoids’16.

    title: "My background"
    excerpt: 'I graduated in [Computer Engineering](http://www.ingegneriainformatica.dibris.unige.it/) in Genoa (Italy) and later I obtained a double degree: Master in Robotics Engineering (University of Genoa) and  Master ARIA in Advanced Robotics (École Centrale de Nantes). 
I also did an internship at IRCCYN (Now called [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en)) on "Pose and velocity estimation for high-speed robot control" (using a vision system) under the supervision of Philippe Martinet.
The goal of the thesis was to develop a method able to estimate the pose and the velocity of a high-speed parallel robot at a very high frequency (1 kHz- 2 kHz). My work was part of the French ANR [Project ARROW](https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~briot-s/ANR_ARROW.html):
Design of Accurate and Fast Robots with Large Operational Workspaces'
